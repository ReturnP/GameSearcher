Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GameSearcher is a web app built with Flask that aims to make it easier to search the
web for information about video games and commenting on them. We decided to make this
web app because none of us had much experience making web applications and we all have
interest in video games.

Dependencies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To use the script you have to have Python installed.
You also need to install Flask (a micro webdevelopment framework) and the Requests library. 
You can do that by running the following commands in a command shell:

	- pip install Flask

	- pip install requests

You of course have to have pip installed to run the commands above.

How to run:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Under the src there is a file called main.py that should be run. It can be run by
using the following command:

	- python main.py

The "python" command could be substituted by "py" or "python3" depending on operating
system.

Accesing the app
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After running the command above the web application can be accesed by opening a web browser
and going to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
